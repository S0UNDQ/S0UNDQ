## Hi there 👋

# 👋 Hi, I’m Dane

Senior **techno‑functional product & portfolio leader** with 15+ years driving ERP, SaaS, and AI‑enabled modernization programs across manufacturing, agriculture, and services. I’ve worked from the shop floor to the C‑suite, leading cross‑functional teams to ship products that actually work for the people who use them. [file:256]

## 🤝 How I Work With Engineering

- Write clear, testable stories and acceptance criteria grounded in real workflows and constraints.  
- Partner with architects and lead engineers on options and tradeoffs, using data to drive decisions.  
- Use metrics (defects, cycle time, adoption, traceability, inventory) to refine roadmaps and prioritize.  
- Mentor product owners, analysts, and SMEs so teams move from “ticket factory” to **outcome‑driven** delivery. [file:256][file:289]
